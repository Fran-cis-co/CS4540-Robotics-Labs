Labs that I have done in the robotics elective class at Cal State LA. All of these were done with an Arduino Uno.
Each code worked on different tasks on the arduino such as getting LED lights to blink at certain speeds to determining the distance of an object using an LCD screen with a ultrasonic sensor.
